    <p><h2>Steak is fairly easy to cook, but success depends significantly on purchasing the right piece of meat.</h2></p>
    </header>

    <p>First, you need to decide what cut of steak you'd like. This decision will depend on what you like: do you prefer tender steaks? Are you interested primarially in flavor? Do you want flavor and tenderness? Do you believe "fat is flavor" or do you prefer leaner meats?</p>
 
    <p>Here's a list of a few popular choices considering the above questions:

    <h3>Hanger Steak</h3> - Lean and flavorful but on the tougher side and, as a result of its leaness a little easier to overcook.</br>

    <h3>Filet Minion</h3> - The tenderest and most flavorless of all steaks, filet minion is also fairly lean and way overpriced for such a flavorless cut.</br>

    <h3>Ribeye</h3> - Ribeye is cut from the rib and can be found boneless or with the rib bone still attached to the side of the steak. It's loaded with flavor, is quite tender, and its high fat content makes it forgiving to cook.</p>
